However, generation of sufficient numbers that possess tissue-specific functions remains a major handicap. Here, we show that fetal liver monocytes (FLiMo) cultured with GM-CSF (also known as CSF2) rapidly differentiate into a long-lived, homogeneous alveolar macrophage (AM)-like population in vitro. CSF2-cultured FLiMo remain the capacity to develop into bona fide AM upon transfer into Csf2ra-/- neonates and prevent development of alveolar proteinosis and efferocytosis of apoptotic cells for at least 1 year in vivo. Compared to transplantation of AM-like cells derived from bone marrow macrophages (BMM), CSF2-cFliMo more efficiently engraft empty AM niches in the lung and protect mice from respiratory viral infection. Harnessing the potential of this approach for gene therapy, we restored a disrupted Csf2ra gene in FLiMo and their capacity to develop into AM in vivo. Together, we provide a novel platform for generation of immature AM-like precursors amenable for genetic manipulation, which will be useful to study to dissect AM development and function and pulmonary transplantation therapy.'"

Our model is suitable to study the relationship between AM and lung tissue, as well as the roles of specific genes or factors in AM development and function. Furthermore, CSF2-cFLiMo can overcome the limitation in macrophage precursor numbers and be used as a therapeutic approach for PAP disease or in other macrophage-based cell therapies including lung emphysema, lung fibrosis, lung infectious disease and lung cancer (Byrne et al, 2016; Lee et al, 2016; Wilson et al, 2010). Finally, genetically modified and transferred CSF2-cFLiMo might facilitate the controlled expression of specific therapeutic proteins in the lung for disease treatment, and therefore, could represent an attractive alternative to non-specific gene delivery by viral vectors.\n",

      "Overall, our studies demonstrate that CSF2-cFLiMo-AM were functionally equivalent to naturally differentiated AM. To determine the number of donor cells required to fully reconstitute the AM compartment of Csf2ra-/- mice, we titrated the number of transferred CSF2-cFLiMo (Fig. 4A). Transfer of a minimum of 5Ã104 CSF2-cFLiMo to neonatal Csf2ra-/- mice resulted in AM numbers in adult recipients that were comparable to unmanipulated WT mice (around 5Ã105) (Fig. 4B) and protected mice from PAP (Fig. 4C). We have previously established that around 10% of primary fetal liver monocytes supplied intranasally reach the lung (Li et al, 2020). Thus, CSF2-cFLiMo have expanded around 100-fold 6 weeks after transfer to Csf2ra-/- neonates. Notably, extended time of CSF2-cFLiMo in vitro culture (i.e. 4 months) prior transfer into recipient mice did not negatively affect their differentiation and functional capacity (Fig. 4B, C). Another critical function of tissue-resident macrophages including AM is the removal of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) (Morioka et al, 2019). We compared efferocytosis between CSF2-cFLiMo-AM in Csf2ra-/- mice and AM in WT mice by intratracheal (i.t.) installation of labelled apoptotic thymocytes. CSF2-cFLiMo-AM and AM were equally potent at phagocytosing apoptotic cells from the bronchoalveolar space (Fig. 4D).\n",

      "Next, we assessed whether CSF2-cFLiMo show therapeutic activity upon transfer into adult Csf2ra-/- mice, which had already developed PAP. Adult Csf2ra-/- mice were transferred i.t. with 0.5, 1 or 2 million CSF2-cFLiMo (Fig. 4E-G). Ten weeks after transfer, donor-derived AM were detectable in the BAL and lung of Csf2ra-/- only in recipients transferred with 2 million cells (Fig. 4F). The protein levels in the BAL from mice transferred with 2Ã106 cells were significantly lower when compared to naÃ¯ve Csf2ra-/- mice, suggesting that transferred cells were able to reduce proteinosis, although not to the level of WT mice (Fig. 4G). However, CSF2-cFLiMo-derived AM exhibited higher expression of F4/80 and CD11b, and lower expression of Siglec-F and CD64 when compared to WT AM (Fig. E5A, B), indicating that the AM phenotype was not fully recapitulated but intermediate between AM-derived from CSF2-cFLiMo transferred to neonates and AM-derived from CSF2-cFLiMo transplanted to adult mice. These results show that CSF2-cFLiMo can reproduce AM phenotype and function most adequately only when transferred to neonatal Csf2ra-/- mice.\n",

      "To assess whether CSF2-cFLiMo can develop to bona fide AM and perform AM function in vivo, we transferred congenically marked CSF2-cFLiMo intranasally (i.n.) to newborn Csf2ra-/- mice (Fig. 1A), which lack AM (Li et al, 2020; Schneider et al, 2017). Analysis of the BAL and lung of Csf2ra-/- recipients showed efficient engraftment of donor-derived cells that resemble mature CD11chiSiglec-Fhi AM (Fig. 1C and Fig. E3A). The numbers of CSF2-cFLiMo-derived AM rapidly increased within the first 6 weeks after transfer, before reaching a relatively stable population size (Fig. 1D), similar to the kinetics during normal postnatal AM differentiation (Guilliams et al, 2013; Schneider et al, 2014). While CSF2-cFLiMo were CD11bhiSiglec-Flo before transfer, they down-regulated CD11b and up-regulated CD11c and Siglec-F surface expression upon transfer and expansion in vivo, indicating that they completed their differentiation to become cells with a phenotype that is indistinguishable from AM of age-matched WT mice (Fig. 1E). Notably, CSF2-cFLiMo-derived AM were maintained in the lung for at least 1 year after transfer (Fig. 1C, D). Moreover, measurement of protein concentration in the BAL at different time points after transfer showed that CSF2-cFLiMo-AM reconstituted Csf2ra-/- mice were completely protected from PAP up to one year (Fig. 1F and Fig. E3B). These results demonstrate that CSF2-cFLiMo develop into mature AM, which appear functionally equivalent to in situ differentiated AM.\n",
